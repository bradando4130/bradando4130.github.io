# bradando4130.github.io

My personal portfolio website with all of the blood sweat and (mostly) tears I have created during my short Front End Web Development career.

Just a short little one page website detailing some of my favorite projects in brief detail,
or in more detail via a clickable modal popup.Along with some information about myself, 
and a contact section for users should they wish to contact me.

Created with HTML5, CSS3, Sass and vanilla JavaScript.

Coded with love and passion by Brad Anderson - 2022
